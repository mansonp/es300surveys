# What Are Surveys?

- Qualitative AND/OR Quantitative
- Many Types: Interviews, Questionnaires
- Respondent Focus - Who Completes Them
- Many Modes: In-person, Door-to-Door, Intercept, Mail, Phone, Online
- Allow for inferences from Sample to Population

--

###When Not to Use Surveys

- Research Questions are Emergent
- Various Sources of <br> Bias or Error Overwhelm
- Population Hard to Reach

# The Why: Theory Rules Everything


---
# The Why: Developing Causal Relationships

## `r emo::ji("thinking")` What is a cause and effect you are interested in? What is the Theory?

--

- `r emo::ji("earth")` Climate change beliefs are determined by party identification

- `r emo::ji("evergreen_tree")` Support for protecting natural areas is predicted by frequent visitation or use

- `r emo::ji("whale")` Support for marine protected areas is driven by concerns over loss of marine health

- Other ideas?

---

# The Why: Developing Causal Relationships

## `r emo::ji("thinking")` What would you ask to test these relationships?

--

-  `r emo::ji("earth")` Do you believe climate change is happening? `r emo::ji("right_arrow")` <br> **Varies by party identification**<br> 

-  `r emo::ji("evergreen_tree")` Willingness to pay for protecting open space, expressed in dollars.  `r emo::ji("right_arrow")` <br> **Varies by visit frequency** 
-  `r emo::ji("whale")` Hypothetical vote for expanding marine protected areas `r emo::ji("right_arrow")` <br> **Varies by perception on marine health** 

- Other ideas?

# The Who: Getting People to Participate

## We *could* just ask everyone! (aka Census)
- Time intensive
- Expensive
- Might actually be less accurate! (Might...)

## Sampling Approaches
- Random 
   - Pure Random, Stratified, Systematic
- Purposive and Quota 
- Intercept
- Snowball 
- Convenience 

???

Census can be less accurate if it has systematic errors in coverage that the sample approach can directly address!

---
# Sample Method Drives Inferences

- Random sample allows for inference from sample to population
- Samples need to be carefully drawn:
   - **Population**: (Universe) Definition: Who do we want to Represent?
   - **Frame**: How we Find our Sample
   - **Sample**: Drawn from Frame, assuming proper *coverage*
   
## Remember Unit of Analysis

- Is it the individual? If so, what is the individual?
- The academic or administrative unit? 
- The whole college?
   
## Sources of Error

- **Coverage Error**: The Frame has a mismatch!
- **Sampling Error**: Size, Response Rates

# The Who: Sampling and Recruitment

---
# How Many Surveys Do we Need?

```{r sample, echo=FALSE}

dillmansamplesize <- read_excel("data/dillmansamplesize.xlsx", 
    col_types = c("text", "numeric", "numeric", 
        "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", 
        "numeric")) 

dillmansamplesize %>%
   kbl(col.names = c("Population Size",
                     "50-50",
                      "80-20",
                      "50-50",
                      "80-20",
                      "50-50",
                      "80-20")) %>%
   kable_styling() %>%
   add_header_above(c("95% Conf Level " = 1, "10% MOE" = 2, "5% MOE" = 2, "3% MOE" = 2)) %>%
   column_spec(1, width = "30em") %>%
   column_spec(2:7, width = "20em") %>%
   footnote(general = "From Dillman et al 2009", general_title = "")
```

???
The confidence interval is the plus-or-minus figure usually reported in newspaper or television opinion poll results. For example, if you use a confidence interval of 4 and 47% percent of your sample picks an answer you can be “sure” that if you had asked the question of the entire relevant population between 43% (47-4) and 51% (47+4) would have picked that answer.

The confidence level tells you how sure you can be. It is expressed as a percentage and represents how often the true percentage of the population who would pick an answer that lies within the confidence interval. The 95% confidence level means you can be 95% certain; the 99% confidence level means you can be 99% certain. Most researchers work for a 95% confidence level.

When you put the confidence level and the confidence interval together, you can say that you are 95% sure that the true percentage of the population is between 43% and 51%.

# How: The Many Modes of Survey Administration

## How we connect to Respondents

- Online
- Mail
- Phone
- Text/SMS
- Door to Door
- Intercept

Each of these involve some form of **recruitment** and may use multiple ways!

**Reed Considerations**: Do you want to capture unique or respondent ID? Use email to capture Reed Community participation? How would you invite them?

# How: The Many Modes of Survey Administration

## How we Encourage Responses

- Make a Connection: Cover Letters and Design
- Partnerships: Trusted Entities
- Incentives
- Use your "Student Card"
- Consider Timing - Know your Population

## Reed Considerations

- What networks can you use?
- What incentives help?

# Measurement Challenges

---

background-image: url("img/reliable_valid.png")
background-position: 100% 75%
background-size: 350pt

# Measurement Challenges


- Are we measuring what we want to measure (**Validity**)?
- Are we successful when repeatedly using the measure (**Reliability**)?

## Some examples

- High Validity and High Reliability: <br> **Respondent's age**
- High Validity and Low Reliability: <br> **Assess classroom inclusion and climate**
- Low Validity and High Reliability: <br> **Are you racist?**
- Low Validity and Low Reliability: <br> **Do you support strenological expansion?**




???

"Strenological expansion" is made up. But its an example of things we could get very wrong if we focus on wonky ideas.

---

# Types of Questions

- Open Ended Questions: Text entry or "in their own words"
- Closed-Ended: Choices are pre-determined

- Other
   - Image Based
   - Participatory GIS
   - Text Interactions
   
   
---

# Choices on Question Design

.pull-left[
## Open-Ended
- Information rich (Good and Bad!)
- Does not prejudge right response
- Allows for uncertainty, where researcher does not know what to expect
- A **lot** of work to analyze
]

.pull-right[
## Close-Ended
- Researcher can control responses (analysis strength)
- Comparisons are easier
- Quicker for respondent
- You have to be very careful on choices you offer!
]
---

# Types of Close-Ended Questions

- Dichotomous
   - Yes or No, Checkbox Questions
- Categorical
   - Often demographic or descriptive
- Ordinal (or acting like it!)
   - Likert scale questions: Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree
- Ratio (rare)
   - Money, thermometers, scales with sliders
   
---

# Anatomy of a Question (aka Item)

- Introduction
- Stem
- Response Options
   - Scale
   - Anchors
   - Odd vs Even Scales (5-pt or 4-pt)
   - Don't Know or Refusal Options
- Presentation Order
   - Questions can be randomized, or reversed
   - Scale can be randomized, or reversed
- Skip or Presentation Logic
   - Present questions based on other responses (aka Fork)
- Soft Requires and Hard Requires
   - Soft: Respondent offerred a second chance if they skip
   - Hard: Respondent can not proceed without answer (consent examople)
   


---

# Danger! Things to Avoid! `r emo::ji("dead")`

- **Double Barrel Questions**:<br> "Do you agree Renn Fayre is safe and fun?"

- **Biased Questions**:<br> "Do you support climate heroes working to stop oil companies?"

- **Overly Leading**: <br> "Do you love Reed College?"

- **Ambiguous or Jargon-loaded**:<br> "Do you never oppose fracking on BLM lands?"

- **Mis-matched Stem and Response Options**: <br> "Do you recycle at home? Every week, occasionally, never."

- **Unbalanced Response Options**:<br> "Disagree, Neither Agree nor Disagree, Agree, Strongly Agree"

---

# Awesome! Things to Definately Do! `r emo::ji("heart")`

- **Use Visual Design**<br> White space, approachable design or colors, images.

- **Language and Accessibility**:<br> Can everyone in your population participate? Translation or other tools to help with accessibility?

- **Make the Benefit Clear**: <br> How can your research change the world?

- **Incentives**: Small tokens go a long way. Can be raffle or payment for all.

- **Do no Harm**:<br> Remember your ethical obligations, do no harm to respondents

---
# Awesome! Things to Definately Do! Pre-Testing! `r emo::ji("heart")` `r emo::ji("heart")`

- **Identify Sample Groups**:
Use of a small sample to pilot test survey. Try to get diversity in this sample to test assumptions.
- **Test Construct Validity**: Fancy pants `r emo::ji("nail_polish")``r emo::ji("jeans")` way of saying: check your question assumptions
   - Vary the question and test two or more versions.
   - Ask a battery and test for how items hang together (Cronbach Alpha)
   - Ask the respondent for feedback with open ended option. <br> "We just asked you to rate X, share three words you would use to describe X"
   - Compare to known or otherwise tested survey questions (other survey projects.)

---
# One Last Thing...

## Response Rates and Weights

- Even if we draw the perfect sample, we miss some people.
- Use of weights to adjust results to capture over and under-representation

## Types of Weights

- **Design Weights**: We might add more people we know are likely to get missed into our sample draw.

- **Post-Stratification/Non-Response**: Once we have our sample, we can adjust to match population characteristics.

# Survey Batteries: New Ecological Paradigm

- Instead of single questions, assembling a series with a **theoretical** connection.



- New Ecological Paradigm asserts a series of statements can capture ecological worldviews (Dunlap and Van Liere 1978, Dunlap 2000)


- Individual items are then combined for analysis

- One dimension captures <br> **New Ecological Paradigm**: more ecocentric
- Other dimension captures <br> **Dominant Social Paradigm**: <br>traditional anthropocentric view


- Lets explore these!



---
# Survey Batteries: New Ecological Paradigm

1. We are approaching the limit of the number of people the Earth can support.

3. When humans interfere with nature it often produces disastrous consequences.

5. Humans are seriously abusing the environment.

7. Plants and animals have as much right as humans to exist.

9. Despite our special abilities, humans are still subject to the laws of nature.

11. The Earth is like a spaceship with very limited room and resources.

13. The balance of nature is very delicate and easily upset.

15. If things continue on their present course, we will soon experience a major ecological catastrophe.
---
# Survey Batteries: Dominant Social Paradigm
2. Humans have the right to modify the natural environment to suit their needs.

4. Human ingenuity will insure that we do not make the Earth unlivable.

6. The Earth has plenty of natural resources if we just learn how to develop them.

8. The balance of nature is strong enough to cope with the impacts of modern industrial nations.

10. The so-called “ecological crisis” facing humankind has been greatly exaggerated.

12. Humans were meant to rule over the rest of nature.

14. Humans will eventually learn enough about how nature works to be able to control it.

# A Note about Ethics

Social science research (including medicine and psychology) has a troubled and racist past: Tuskegee Syphilis Study (1932-1972); Baltimore Lead Paint Study (1990s)

- **Belmont Report** defines guiding ethical principles:
   
   - *Respect for People*: Informed consent and protection of autonomy
   
   - *Beneficence*: Do no harm, and balance risks and benefits of research
   
   - *Justice*: Reasonable, non-exploitative, and well-considered procedure. Fairness in costs and burdens.

We must review any **human subjects research** with our **Institutional Research Board** (IRB)


---
# What is Research?

"Research means a **systematic investigation**, including research development, testing, and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to **generalizable knowledge**." [45 CFR 46.102](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-A/part-46#46.102)

## Historians get a Pass

"For purposes of this part, the following activities are deemed not to be research:

Scholarly and journalistic activities (e.g., oral history, journalism, biography, literary criticism, legal research, and historical scholarship), including the collection and use of information, that focus directly on the specific individuals about whom the information is collected."

### Historians, Public Health, Criminal Investigations, and Homeland Security all exempted

---
# Is it Research on Human Subjects?

"Human subjects research is a project that involves a living individual about whom the investigator (whether student or professional):

(i) obtains information or biospecimens through interaction/intervention with the individual, and uses, studies, or analyzes the information or biospecimens; or 

(ii) obtains, uses studies, analyzes, or **generates identifiable private information** or identifiable biospecimens." [45 CFR 46.102](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-A/part-46#46.102)

**Example:** 

Ask a person how much a house costs - *Not* Human Subjects Research

Ask a person if they would like to own a house - **Yes**, Human Subjects Research


---
# IRB Review

Some types of research are exempt - BUT still require documentation.

- Anonymous surveys (web panels a common example)

- Surveys with identifiers - but mitigated by protections

- Public observation
- **Key**: Interpretation is squishy - often this is expedited to be safe at Reed.

Expedited Review is more common - were the risk is no more than would be expected in daily life.


**What are risks you can think of in research?**
